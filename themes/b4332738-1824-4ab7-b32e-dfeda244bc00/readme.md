# Better Toolbar Margins
By default, the toolbar margins in Zen Browser are very tight. This mod improves both the toolbar and sidebar margins.
Unlike other mods, this one has been extensively tested and works with any layout.

> Mods may break in later versions. I use these mods myself, and keep them up-to-date with the latest versions of Zen. If something doesn't work as intended, feel free to [reach out](mailto:roman@rsiebert.dev).
