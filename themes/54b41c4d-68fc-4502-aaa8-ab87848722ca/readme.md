# Singular Workspace Selector

A simple Zen Browser mod that removes the workspace selector displayed at the top of the tab list, creating a cleaner and more focused browsing experience.

## About

This mod gives you back the space at the top of your tab list by removing the workspace selector. With the extra room, your sidebar looks more minimal and uncluttered, helping you focus on what actually matters—viewing your tabs.

## Usage

Once installed, the workspace selector at the top of the tab list should be hidden automatically. To revert to the default view, remove the mod from the custom mods folder or disable it in Zen Browser’s settings.
